## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pern-store.git
   cd pern-store
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   PORT=8080
   PGUSER=your_db_user
   PGPASSWORD=your_db_password
   PGHOST=your_db_host
   PGDATABASE=your_db_name
   ARCJET_KEY=your_arcjet_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```bash
   # Start backend server (from root directory)
   npm run dev

   # Start frontend development server (from client directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  image VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

## üîê API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint          | Description            |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | /api/products     | Get all products       |
| GET    | /api/products/:id | Get a specific product |
| POST   | /api/products     | Create a new product   |
| PUT    | /api/products/:id | Update a product       |
| DELETE | /api/products/:id | Delete a product       |

## üì± Performance Optimization

This application implements several performance optimizations:

- **Pagination**: Limit products loaded at once
- **Image Lazy Loading**: Load images only when needed
- **Component Memoization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Code Splitting**: Reduce initial bundle size
- **Production Builds**: Optimized for deployment

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is configured for production deployment:

1. Build the client

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the server in production mode
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

## üß™ Future Enhancements
